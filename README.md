# 🔧 LLM Fine-Tuning from Scratch (Hands-on, Practical)

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end **Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning workflow**, built with a practical, engineering-first mindset.  
The goal is simple: **understand what actually happens when you fine-tune an LLM**, not just call an API and pray.

This project walks through dataset preparation, tokenization, training, evaluation, and inference — all inside a clean, reproducible notebook.

## 🚀 Why This Project?

Most tutorials stop at:
> “Load model → fine-tune → done 🎉”

This project goes further:
- Why certain preprocessing choices matter  
- How fine-tuning changes model behavior  
- Where things break (and how to fix them)
- How to structure this work for **real research / internships / industry use**

Think of this as **LLM fine-tuning without the smoke and mirrors**.

## 📊 Key Learnings

- Fine-tuning is less about compute and more about **data discipline**
- Small datasets + correct formatting > large noisy datasets
- Debugging loss curves tells you more than metrics alone
- LLMs amplify both good and bad data — choose wisely

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Research internships (IITs / labs / professors)
- AI/ML engineering interviews
- Foundation for domain-specific LLMs (legal, medical, engineering)
- Starting point for LoRA / PEFT / instruction tuning

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Add LoRA / PEFT fine-tuning  
- Compare base vs fine-tuned model outputs  
- Convert into a Streamlit demo  
- Extend to domain-specific datasets
